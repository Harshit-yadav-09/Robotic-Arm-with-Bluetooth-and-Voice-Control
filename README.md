# Robotic-Arm-with-Bluetooth-and-Voice-Control
I developed a robotic arm that can be controlled using voice commands and buttons after connecting to a mobile device via Bluetooth. It also features voice response capabilities. This project helped me secure the first position in the second-year project presentation. Further details are available in the README file.
